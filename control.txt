	taxCode_percent = 0
else if taxCode = 1 then
	taxCode_percent = .03
else if taxCode = 2 then
	taxCode_percent = .05
else if taxCode = 3
	then taxCode_percent = .07
	
taxAmountDue = purchaseAmout * (taxCode_percent/100)
totalAmountDue = purchaseAmount + taxDue

display customerName, purchaseAmout, taxDue, totalAmountDue

Pseuocode:
Set salesTax to zero
Set totalAmountDue to zero
Prompt user for customerName
Get customerName
Prompt user for purchaseAmount
Get purchaseAmount
Prompt user for taxCode
Get taxCode

IF taxCode == 0 
	Set salesTax = 0
	Set totalAmountDue = purchaseAmount
	Display customerName, purchaseAmount, salesTax, and totalAmountDue
ELSE IF taxCode == 1
	Calculate salesTax = purchaseAmount * .03
	Calculate totalAmountDue = purchaseAmount + salesTax
	Display customerName, purchaseAmount, salesTax, and totalAmountDue
ELSE IF taxCode == 2
	Calculate salesTax = purchaseAmount * .05
	Calculate totalAmountDue = purchaseAmount + salesTax
	Display customerName, purchaseAmount, salesTax, and totalAmountDue
ELSE IF taxCode == 3

Tests
customerName = Dave Max, purchaseAmount = 320, taxCode = 0
output should be Amy Ramirez, $320, $0, $320
salesTax = 0
totalAmountDue = 320

customerName = Mike Smith, purchaseAmount = 245, taxCode = 2
output should be Steven Johnson, $245, $12.25, $257.25
salesTax = 245 * 0.05 = 12.25
totalAmountDue = 245 + 12.25 = 257.25

Input:
employeeNameNumber
payRate
numberOfHour

Output:
employeeNameNumber
payRate
totalHourWorked
weeklyPay

PROCESSING STEPS

if numberOfHour > 60 or PayRate > 25
then print employeeNameNumber
           payRate
		   totalHourWorked
	print "try again"

else if numberOfHour <= 35
    weeklyPay = totalHourWorked * payRate
	
else if numberOfHour > 35
		overTime = numberOfHour - 35
		weeklyPay =  (payRate * 35) + (overTime * payRate * 1.5)

Print 
employeeNameNumber
payRate
totalHourWorked
weeklyPay		

PSEUDOCODE
Initialize weeklyPay to zero
Prompt user for employeeNameNumber
Get employeeNameNumber
Prompt user for payRate
Get payRate
Prompt user for totalHourWorked
Get totalHourWorked
IF totalHourWorked <= 60 AND payRate <= 25
	IF totalHourWorked <= 35 
		Calculate weeklyPay = totalHourWorked * payRate
		Display employeeNameNumber, payRate, totalHourWorked, and weeklyPay
	ELSE
		Calculate weeklyPay = (35 * payRate) + (totalHourWorked - 35) * payRate * 1.5)
		Display employeeNameNumber, payRate, totalHourWorked, and weeklyPay
	ENDIF
ELSE IF totalHourWorked > 60
	Error exceeded maximum hours
ELSE IF payRate > 25
	Error exceeded pay rate
